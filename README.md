## Demo

- https://nitish1977.github.io/Stopwatch/


## Features

- Interface Design:

  Main Display: Displays the current time elapsed in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

  Buttons: Four buttons labeled "Start," "Pause," "Reset," and "Lap."

  Lap Times: A section below the main display showing a list of lap times recorded.

- Functionality:

  Start Button: Starts the stopwatch from 00:00:00.0 or resumes it from the paused state.

  Pause Button: Pauses the stopwatch, stopping the time but keeping the current elapsed time displayed.

  Reset Button: Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00.0 and clears any recorded lap times.

  Lap Button: Records the current elapsed time and adds it to the list of lap times. This does not stop or pause the stopwatch.

- User Experience:

  Interactive: The buttons should change state (e.g., "Start" to "Pause" when the stopwatch is running).

  Responsive: The lap times list should update immediately with each lap recorded.
